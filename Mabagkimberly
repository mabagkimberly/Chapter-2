# Creating Hello World App
*Flutter development from this chapter. First, I learned how to create a new Flutter mobile app, 
which involves setting up Flutter and using the flutter create command to generate the app structure. 
Next, I discovered the importance of hot reload, a feature that allows me to quickly see changes in the app without restarting it,
which speeds up the development process.
*I also learned how to style the app using themes, which helps in maintaining a consistent look across the app. 
By defining a central ThemeData, I can control the colors, fonts, and other visual elements throughout the app.
Additionally, I explored the difference between stateless and stateful widgets. Stateless widgets are ideal for static content,
while stateful widgets are used when the UI needs to change dynamically based on user interaction or other factors.Lastly,
I learned how to add external packages to the app using Flutterâ€™s package manager.
